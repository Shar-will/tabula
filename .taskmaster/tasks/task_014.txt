# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Robust Error Handling and Edge Case Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Handle errors from Chrome APIs, IndexedDB, and UI gracefully with user-friendly messages and fallback logic.
# Details:
Catch and display errors for API failures, storage issues, and invalid user actions. Provide fallback UI for corrupted data or unavailable APIs. Log errors for debugging.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate API/storage failures and invalid actions. Verify error messages and fallback behavior. Check for no data loss.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit and Categorize Error Sources [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify all potential error sources in Chrome APIs, IndexedDB operations, and UI interactions. Categorize errors by type (e.g., API failure, storage issue, invalid user action, corrupted data).
### Details:
Review all code paths that interact with Chrome APIs, IndexedDB, and user input. Document possible failure modes for each. Categorize errors into actionable groups (e.g., recoverable, non-recoverable, user-correctable). This forms the foundation for targeted handling and messaging.

## 2. Implement Centralized Error Logging and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Create a centralized error logging system to capture, store, and monitor errors from all sources for debugging and analytics.
### Details:
Design a logging utility that records error details (type, message, stack trace, context) from Chrome APIs, IndexedDB, and UI. Ensure logs are accessible for debugging and optionally persisted for post-mortem analysis. Integrate with existing monitoring tools if available.

## 3. Design and Implement User-Friendly Error Messaging [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Develop a consistent, user-friendly error messaging system that displays clear, actionable messages for each error category without exposing sensitive details.
### Details:
Define a message schema with error codes, short summaries, and detailed user guidance. Implement UI components to display these messages contextually (e.g., toast, modal, inline). Ensure messages are actionable and avoid technical jargon. Reference best practices for clarity and security.

## 4. Implement Fallback Logic and Recovery Flows [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.3
### Description: Develop fallback mechanisms and recovery flows for critical error scenarios, such as unavailable APIs, storage failures, or corrupted data.
### Details:
For each error category, define appropriate fallback actions (e.g., retry, default state, alternative UI, data reset). Implement logic to gracefully degrade functionality or guide users through recovery steps. Ensure the app remains usable and data loss is minimized.

## 5. Integrate and Test Edge Case Handling Across the Application [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.3, 14.4
### Description: Integrate error handling, messaging, and fallback logic throughout the application. Systematically test all edge cases to ensure robust, graceful behavior.
### Details:
Refactor application code to use centralized error handling and messaging. Conduct comprehensive testing of all identified edge cases, including rare or complex failure scenarios. Document test results and iterate on handling as needed.
