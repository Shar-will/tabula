# Task ID: 2
# Title: Create Manifest V3 and Chrome Extension Boilerplate
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop manifest.json with required permissions, new tab override, and CSP. Scaffold extension entry points.
# Details:
Write manifest.json with name, version, permissions (tabs, storage, activeTab), background service worker, and newtab override. Set CSP to 'script-src 'self'; object-src 'self''. Scaffold index.html and entry JS/TS files.

# Test Strategy:
Load extension in Chrome (Developer Mode). Confirm new tab override and permissions are recognized.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Draft manifest.json with Required Fields and Permissions [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the manifest.json file specifying the extension's name, version, manifest_version (3), required permissions (tabs, storage, activeTab), background service worker, and new tab override.
### Details:
Define the manifest.json structure according to Chrome Manifest V3 specification. Include fields: name, version, manifest_version: 3, permissions: ["tabs", "storage", "activeTab"], background with service_worker entry, and chrome_url_overrides for newtab. Ensure all required fields are present and valid.

## 2. Configure Content Security Policy (CSP) in manifest.json [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Set the extension's Content Security Policy to restrict script and object sources as required.
### Details:
Add the 'content_security_policy' key to manifest.json with the value: {"extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'"}. Ensure this CSP applies to all extension pages and complies with Manifest V3 requirements.

## 3. Scaffold Extension Entry Points: index.html and Main JS/TS Files [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Create the primary HTML and JavaScript/TypeScript files that serve as entry points for the extension's UI and background logic.
### Details:
Create index.html for the new tab override, referencing the main JS/TS bundle. Scaffold background.js (or .ts) for the service worker. Ensure file paths match those referenced in manifest.json. Use minimal boilerplate code to confirm loading.

## 4. Implement New Tab Override Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Ensure the extension correctly overrides the browser's new tab page with the custom index.html.
### Details:
Configure chrome_url_overrides in manifest.json to point to the custom index.html. Test that opening a new tab displays the extension's page instead of the default Chrome new tab.

## 5. Verify and Document Boilerplate Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Test the extension in Chrome, verify all boilerplate components function as intended, and document the setup for future development.
### Details:
Load the extension in Chrome (Developer Mode). Confirm manifest fields, permissions, CSP, new tab override, and entry points work as expected. Create a README or setup notes summarizing the boilerplate structure and usage.
