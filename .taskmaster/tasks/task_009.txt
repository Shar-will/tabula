# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Individual Tab Management and Display
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Handle tab display, click-to-open, favicon rendering, and URL validation within groups and sidebar.
# Details:
Truncate tab titles to 15 chars. Render favicons in circular frames with 5px padding and border. On click, open tab URL in current tab. Validate URLs and clean up dead links. Support tab drag-and-drop.

# Test Strategy:
Open tabs via UI, check favicon and title rendering, test URL validation and error handling. Drag tabs within/between groups.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Render Tab List with Truncated Titles and Favicon Styling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Display all tabs within their respective groups and the sidebar, ensuring tab titles are truncated to 15 characters and favicons are rendered in circular frames with 5px padding and border.
### Details:
Implement a tab list component that iterates through tab data for each group and the sidebar. For each tab, display the title truncated to 15 characters. Render the favicon inside a circular container with 5px padding and a visible border. Use CSS for circular cropping and padding. Ensure the layout is consistent across groups and the sidebar.

## 2. Implement Click-to-Open Tab Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Enable users to open a tab's URL in the current browser tab when clicking on a tab entry in the UI.
### Details:
Attach click event handlers to each tab entry. On click, validate the tab's URL and use the appropriate browser API (e.g., window.location or extension API) to open the URL in the current tab. Ensure the UI provides feedback (e.g., loading state) during navigation.

## 3. Validate Tab URLs and Clean Up Dead Links [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Check each tab's URL for validity and remove or flag tabs with dead or unreachable links.
### Details:
Implement a URL validation function that checks for proper URL format and optionally pings the URL to verify reachability. For dead or invalid links, either remove the tab from the list or display a warning icon. Provide a cleanup action to remove all flagged tabs.

## 4. Enable Tab Drag-and-Drop within and Between Groups [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Allow users to drag tabs to reorder them within a group or move them between groups and the sidebar.
### Details:
Integrate a drag-and-drop library or use native HTML5 drag-and-drop APIs. Implement handlers for drag start, drag over, and drop events. Update the tab data structure to reflect new positions or group assignments after drop. Ensure visual feedback during dragging.

## 5. Synchronize Tab State with Sidebar and Group Views [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Ensure that all tab management actions (display, open, validation, drag-and-drop) are consistently reflected in both group and sidebar views.
### Details:
Implement a shared state management solution (e.g., React context, Redux, or equivalent) to synchronize tab data across all components. Ensure that any changes (opening, removal, reordering, validation) are immediately reflected in both the group and sidebar displays. Handle edge cases such as simultaneous updates or conflicts.
