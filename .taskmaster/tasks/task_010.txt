# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Data Persistence and State Restoration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure all tab, group, and workspace data is persisted in IndexedDB and restored on extension load.
# Details:
On extension startup, load data from IndexedDB and hydrate UI state. Save all changes (tab/group/workspace edits, drag-and-drop) to IndexedDB. Handle data migration and error recovery.

# Test Strategy:
Simulate extension reload and browser restart. Verify all data is restored. Test data integrity after multiple operations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Data Models and Migration Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and document the data models for tabs, groups, and workspaces, and establish a versioned migration strategy for IndexedDB schema changes.
### Details:
Specify the structure and relationships for all entities (tabs, groups, workspaces) to be persisted. Implement a versioning system for the IndexedDB schema. Write migration functions to handle upgrades and downgrades between schema versions, ensuring backward compatibility and data integrity.

## 2. Implement IndexedDB Persistence Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop a robust persistence layer using idb or Dexie.js to handle CRUD operations for all entities, including error handling and transaction management.
### Details:
Set up IndexedDB using the chosen library. Implement create, read, update, and delete operations for tabs, groups, and workspaces. Ensure all operations are atomic and handle errors gracefully, providing fallback or retry logic as needed.

## 3. Integrate State Loading and Hydration on Extension Startup [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: On extension load, retrieve persisted data from IndexedDB and hydrate the UI state, ensuring all tabs, groups, and workspaces are restored accurately.
### Details:
Implement startup logic to load all relevant data from IndexedDB before rendering the UI. Map persisted data to in-memory state structures used by the UI. Handle cases where data is missing, corrupted, or partially migrated, and provide user feedback or recovery options.

## 4. Persist State Changes on User Actions [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Ensure all user actions that modify tabs, groups, or workspaces (including edits and drag-and-drop) are immediately and reliably persisted to IndexedDB.
### Details:
Attach persistence logic to all relevant UI actions. Use debouncing or batching where appropriate to optimize write frequency. Confirm that every change (creation, update, deletion, reordering) is reflected in IndexedDB and that the UI remains in sync with the persisted state.

## 5. Implement Error Recovery and Data Integrity Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Detect and handle errors during data load/save operations, and implement integrity checks to prevent or recover from data corruption.
### Details:
Add error handling for all IndexedDB operations, including user notifications and automatic retries where feasible. Implement integrity checks (e.g., schema validation, orphaned references) during load and save. Provide mechanisms to repair or reset corrupted data, with clear user prompts if intervention is needed.
