# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Comprehensive Drag and Drop System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement drag-and-drop for tabs and groups using react-dnd or @dnd-kit/core, supporting all specified drag scenarios.
# Details:
Enable dragging tabs from sidebar to groups/canvas, between groups, and within groups. Provide visual feedback (line indicator, drop zone highlighting) using Framer Motion. Ensure drop actions update IndexedDB and UI state.

# Test Strategy:
Test all drag scenarios: sidebar→group, sidebar→canvas, group→group, within group, group→canvas. Validate drop feedback and data updates.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Drag-and-Drop Context and Providers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize the drag-and-drop system by integrating react-dnd or @dnd-kit/core at the root of the relevant component tree, ensuring all child components have access to DnD context.
### Details:
Wrap the main application or the relevant subtree with the DnD context provider (DndProvider for react-dnd or DndContext for @dnd-kit/core). Choose the appropriate backend (e.g., HTML5Backend for react-dnd). Ensure the context is accessible to all tab, group, and sidebar components that will participate in drag-and-drop.

## 2. Implement Draggable and Droppable Tab and Group Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Make tab and group components draggable and define valid drop targets for all required scenarios: sidebar to group/canvas, between groups, and within groups.
### Details:
For each tab and group, implement drag source and drop target logic using the chosen DnD library. Assign unique IDs to all draggable items. Configure drop targets to accept the correct item types and handle drop events. Ensure all specified drag scenarios are supported, including dragging from the sidebar to groups/canvas, between groups, and within groups.

## 3. Integrate Visual Feedback with Framer Motion [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Provide real-time visual feedback during drag operations, including line indicators and drop zone highlighting, using Framer Motion for smooth animations.
### Details:
On drag start, animate the dragged item and highlight potential drop zones using Framer Motion. Display a line indicator or highlight effect at the intended drop location. Ensure feedback is responsive and visually distinct for each drag scenario.

## 4. Update IndexedDB and UI State on Drop Actions [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Ensure that all drop actions persist changes to IndexedDB and update the UI state to reflect the new tab/group arrangement.
### Details:
On successful drop, update the relevant data structures in IndexedDB to reflect the new positions of tabs and groups. Synchronize the UI state with the persisted data to ensure consistency. Handle edge cases such as invalid drops or concurrent updates.

## 5. Comprehensive Testing of All Drag-and-Drop Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Test all supported drag-and-drop scenarios, including sidebar to group/canvas, between groups, within groups, and group to canvas, ensuring correct feedback and data updates.
### Details:
Create a test plan covering each drag scenario. Manually and/or programmatically test dragging tabs and groups in all directions. Validate that visual feedback appears as expected and that data is correctly updated in both UI and IndexedDB. Address any discovered bugs or inconsistencies.
