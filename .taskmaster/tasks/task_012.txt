# Task ID: 12
# Title: Integrate Framer Motion Animations and UI Polish
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add smooth animations for sidebar, workspace switching, drag-and-drop, and UI transitions using Framer Motion and cubic-bezier easing.
# Details:
Apply Framer Motion to sidebar expand/collapse, workspace slide, drag feedback, and context menus. Use cubic-bezier for all transitions. Polish UI per design system (typography, color palette, favicon styling).

# Test Strategy:
Review all animated interactions for smoothness and performance. Compare against design specs. Test on various screen sizes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Sidebar Expand/Collapse Animation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Apply Framer Motion to animate the sidebar's expand and collapse transitions, ensuring smooth cubic-bezier easing and responsive performance.
### Details:
Wrap the sidebar container with Framer Motion's motion component. Define initial, animate, and exit states for width and opacity. Use a cubic-bezier curve for the transition property. Ensure the sidebar animates on hover and button toggle, and test for performance on various screen sizes.

## 2. Animate Workspace Switching Transitions [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Integrate Framer Motion to animate workspace switching, such as sliding or fading between workspace views, using cubic-bezier transitions.
### Details:
Wrap the workspace container with AnimatePresence and motion components. Define slide-in and slide-out variants for workspace transitions. Apply cubic-bezier easing to all transitions. Ensure the animation is triggered on workspace switch and is interruptible.

## 3. Add Drag-and-Drop Feedback Animations [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Use Framer Motion to provide animated feedback for drag-and-drop interactions, including tab groups and drop zones.
### Details:
Enhance drag sources and drop targets with motion components. Animate scale, shadow, and opacity during drag. Animate drop zone appearance using cubic-bezier transitions. Ensure feedback is immediate and visually clear for all drag-and-drop actions.

## 4. Animate Context Menus and UI Transitions [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Apply Framer Motion to context menus and other UI overlays, ensuring all transitions use cubic-bezier easing and match design system guidelines.
### Details:
Wrap context menu components with motion elements. Define fade and scale transitions for menu open/close. Use AnimatePresence for mounting/unmounting. Apply cubic-bezier transitions and ensure accessibility (focus management, keyboard navigation).

## 5. Polish UI per Design System (Typography, Colors, Favicon) [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Refine all UI elements to match the design system, including typography, color palette, and favicon styling, ensuring consistency across all animated components.
### Details:
Audit all UI components for adherence to the design system. Update typography (font families, sizes, weights), apply the correct color palette, and style favicons as specified. Ensure all animated elements retain visual consistency before and after transitions.
