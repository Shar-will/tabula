# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Accessibility and Responsive Design
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 8, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, and responsive layouts for all components.
# Details:
Add keyboard navigation for sidebar, canvas, groups, and workspaces. Use ARIA attributes for interactive elements. Make layout responsive for different screen sizes.

# Test Strategy:
Test with keyboard only. Use screen readers to verify accessibility. Resize window and check responsive behavior.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Keyboard Navigation for Sidebar [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enable full keyboard navigation for the sidebar, ensuring users can access all sidebar controls and items using only the keyboard.
### Details:
Add tabindex attributes to all interactive sidebar elements. Use native HTML elements (e.g., <button>, <a>) where possible for built-in accessibility. Implement keyboard event handlers (Arrow keys, Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space) to allow navigation and activation of sidebar items. Ensure focus indicators are visible and logical.

## 2. Add Keyboard Navigation to Canvas, Groups, and Workspaces [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Extend keyboard navigation to the canvas area, tab groups, and workspace controls, ensuring all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard.
### Details:
Assign tabindex and appropriate roles to canvas, group, and workspace controls. Implement keyboard handlers for navigation between groups and workspaces (e.g., Arrow keys to move between groups, Enter to select). Ensure logical focus management when moving between sidebar, canvas, and workspace elements.

## 3. Apply ARIA Roles and Attributes to Interactive Elements [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Add ARIA roles and attributes to all custom and interactive elements to enhance compatibility with assistive technologies.
### Details:
Identify all non-native interactive elements (custom buttons, dialogs, navigation regions). Assign appropriate ARIA roles (e.g., role="button", role="navigation"). Add ARIA states and properties such as aria-expanded, aria-label, aria-labelledby, and aria-disabled as needed. Ensure all interactive elements have accessible names, using visible labels or ARIA attributes as appropriate[1][2][3][4][5].

## 4. Implement Responsive Layouts for All Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Ensure that the sidebar, canvas, groups, and workspace layouts adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and orientations.
### Details:
Use CSS media queries and flexible layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid) to adjust component sizes, spacing, and arrangement for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. Test with various viewport sizes to ensure usability and readability. Avoid horizontal scrolling and ensure touch targets are appropriately sized on small screens.

## 5. Conduct Accessibility and Responsiveness Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.4
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing to validate keyboard navigation, ARIA implementation, and responsive design across all components.
### Details:
Test the application using keyboard only, screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver), and by resizing the window or using device emulators. Address any accessibility or layout issues found. Document test results and any remaining accessibility limitations.
