# Task ID: 15
# Title: Final Testing, Performance Optimization, and Chrome Web Store Preparation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct end-to-end testing, optimize performance, and prepare extension for Chrome Web Store submission.
# Details:
Test all features for correctness and performance (load time <1s, drag <100ms, workspace switch <500ms). Optimize memory usage. Review permissions and manifest. Prepare assets and documentation for Chrome Web Store.

# Test Strategy:
Run manual and automated tests. Measure performance metrics. Validate against Chrome Web Store requirements. Conduct user acceptance testing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Conduct Automated and Manual End-to-End Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of all extension features using both automated tools and manual user flows to ensure correctness and stability.
### Details:
Use tools such as Playwright or Puppeteer to automate user interactions and verify all extension workflows, including popup, background, and content scripts. Supplement with manual testing to cover edge cases and UI/UX flows that are difficult to automate. Ensure tests cover all supported Chrome versions and platforms.

## 2. Measure and Optimize Performance Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Profile and optimize the extension to meet performance targets for load time, drag latency, workspace switching, and memory usage.
### Details:
Use Chrome DevTools and browser profiling tools to measure load time (<1s), drag latency (<100ms), and workspace switch time (<500ms). Identify bottlenecks in rendering, event handling, and data processing. Optimize code, reduce bundle size, and minimize memory usage. Re-test after optimizations to confirm improvements.

## 3. Review and Refine Permissions and Manifest [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Audit the manifest.json and all requested permissions to ensure minimal, necessary access and compliance with Chrome Web Store policies.
### Details:
Review manifest.json for required permissions, background/service worker configuration, and content security policy. Remove any unnecessary permissions. Ensure manifest fields (name, version, description, icons, etc.) are accurate and complete. Validate against the latest Chrome Web Store requirements.

## 4. Prepare Chrome Web Store Assets and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Create and finalize all required assets and documentation for Chrome Web Store submission, including icons, screenshots, promotional images, and user-facing descriptions.
### Details:
Generate icons in all required sizes (16x16, 48x48, 128x128, etc.). Capture high-quality screenshots and promotional images showing key extension features. Write a clear, concise store description, usage instructions, and privacy policy. Ensure all assets meet Chrome Web Store guidelines.

## 5. Perform Final Compliance Check and Submission Readiness Review [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4
### Description: Verify that the extension package, assets, and documentation meet all Chrome Web Store requirements and are ready for submission.
### Details:
Run the Chrome Web Store extension checklist, including automated and manual compliance checks. Confirm that all features work as intended, assets are present, and documentation is complete. Prepare the final ZIP package for upload. Address any last-minute issues or feedback.
