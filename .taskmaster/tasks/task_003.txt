# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement IndexedDB Schema and Persistence Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up IndexedDB using idb or Dexie.js for local storage of workspaces, tab groups, tabs, and deleted items.
# Details:
Define schema: workspaces, tabGroups, tabs, deletedItems. Implement CRUD operations and data migration logic. Ensure all data is stored locally and supports offline use.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for CRUD operations. Simulate offline mode and verify data persistence and restoration.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define IndexedDB Schema for All Data Entities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and declare the IndexedDB schema with object stores for workspaces, tabGroups, tabs, and deletedItems, including appropriate key paths and indexes.
### Details:
Use idb or Dexie.js to define object stores for each entity. Assign unique key paths (e.g., 'id') and create necessary indexes for efficient querying. Ensure the schema is normalized to reduce redundancy and supports future migrations. Increment the database version number for schema changes and implement all schema modifications within the onupgradeneeded event handler.

## 2. Implement CRUD Operations for Each Object Store [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop create, read, update, and delete operations for workspaces, tabGroups, tabs, and deletedItems using the chosen IndexedDB wrapper.
### Details:
For each object store, implement functions to add, retrieve (by key and by index), update, and delete records. Use transactions with appropriate modes ('readonly' or 'readwrite') and handle errors using event handlers. Ensure all operations are asynchronous and return Promises.

## 3. Implement Data Migration Logic for Schema Evolution [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Add logic to handle schema upgrades and data migrations when the database version changes, ensuring backward compatibility and data integrity.
### Details:
Within the onupgradeneeded event, detect the oldVersion and apply conditional migration steps for each version increment. Migrate or transform existing data as needed to fit the new schema. Test migration paths from all supported previous versions.

## 4. Integrate Persistence Layer with Offline Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Ensure all CRUD operations and data access work seamlessly offline, and that the persistence layer is robust against connectivity changes.
### Details:
Test and handle scenarios where the application is offline, ensuring all data operations are queued or handled locally. Use IndexedDB's offline-first capabilities to guarantee data is always available. Implement error handling for failed transactions and provide graceful degradation if storage is unavailable.

## 5. Write Comprehensive Unit Tests for Persistence Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Develop and execute unit tests covering all CRUD operations, migrations, and offline scenarios for the IndexedDB persistence layer.
### Details:
Use a testing framework to mock IndexedDB and simulate various scenarios, including normal operations, migrations, and offline/online transitions. Validate data integrity, error handling, and transaction completion. Ensure tests are repeatable and cover all edge cases.
