			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Chrome Extension Project with React, Vite, and Tailwind",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project initialization into subtasks: (1) Create Vite React project, (2) Integrate Tailwind CSS, (3) Add shadcn/ui, (4) Configure Vite for Chrome Extension output and Manifest V3, (5) Set up project structure (public, src, manifest.json), (6) Add Framer Motion and react-dnd/@dnd-kit/core dependencies. For each, specify configuration and verification steps.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple integrations and configuration steps, each with its own setup and verification. While not algorithmically complex, the breadth of tooling and the need for Chrome Extension compatibility increases setup complexity and risk of misconfiguration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Workspace Management Bar and Switching",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks: (1) Render workspace bar UI with tab limits, (2) Implement workspace creation/deletion, (3) Add slide animation for switching, (4) Persist workspace state in IndexedDB, (5) Restore last active workspace on load. For each, detail UI, state, and animation logic.",
			"reasoning": "Requires UI development, animation, state management, and IndexedDB integration. The need for smooth UX and persistent state adds moderate complexity, especially for edge cases like workspace limits and restoration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create Manifest V3 and Chrome Extension Boilerplate",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) Write manifest.json with all required fields and permissions, (2) Set up background service worker and new tab override, (3) Configure CSP, (4) Scaffold index.html and entry JS/TS files. For each, specify validation and Chrome loading steps.",
			"reasoning": "Boilerplate setup is straightforward but requires attention to Chrome Extension specifics (permissions, CSP, service worker). Each step is well-defined but must be correct for the extension to load and function."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement IndexedDB Schema and Persistence Layer",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Define IndexedDB schema for all entities, (2) Implement CRUD operations, (3) Add data migration logic, (4) Integrate with idb/Dexie.js, (5) Ensure offline support, (6) Write unit tests for all operations. For each, specify schema, API, and test details.",
			"reasoning": "Designing a robust persistence layer with schema, migrations, and offline support is complex and error-prone. Requires careful planning, API design, and thorough testing to ensure data integrity and future extensibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Comprehensive Drag and Drop System",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Enable drag from sidebar to groups/canvas, (2) Drag between groups, (3) Drag within groups, (4) Implement visual feedback with Framer Motion, (5) Update IndexedDB and UI state on drop, (6) Handle edge cases (invalid drops, reordering), (7) Test all drag scenarios. For each, specify UI, state, and feedback logic.",
			"reasoning": "Drag-and-drop across multiple contexts with real-time feedback, persistence, and edge case handling is highly complex. Requires coordination between UI, state, and storage, with significant testing for reliability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Recent Tabs Sidebar with Real-Time Chrome Tabs API Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Integrate Chrome Tabs API for fetching/updating tabs, (2) Implement real-time event listeners, (3) Build collapsible sidebar UI, (4) Render tab titles and favicons, (5) Animate expand/collapse on hover, (6) Validate against design specs. For each, specify API, UI, and animation details.",
			"reasoning": "Requires real-time integration with Chrome APIs, responsive UI, and animation. Handling asynchronous updates and ensuring UI consistency adds significant complexity, especially for edge cases and performance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Robust Error Handling and Edge Case Management",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) Handle Chrome API errors, (2) Handle IndexedDB/storage errors, (3) Handle UI/user action errors, (4) Provide user-friendly error messages, (5) Implement fallback UI for corrupted/unavailable data, (6) Add error logging for debugging. For each, specify error scenarios and handling logic.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive error handling across APIs, storage, and UI is complex, requiring anticipation of many failure modes and graceful recovery. User messaging and fallback logic must be robust and well-tested."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Data Persistence and State Restoration",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Load data from IndexedDB on startup, (2) Hydrate UI state, (3) Persist all changes (tab/group/workspace edits, drag-and-drop), (4) Handle data migration, (5) Implement error recovery, (6) Test restoration after reload/restart, (7) Validate data integrity after multiple operations. For each, specify data flow and recovery logic.",
			"reasoning": "Ensuring reliable persistence and restoration across all entities and operations is highly complex, especially with concurrent changes, migrations, and error recovery. Requires deep integration and extensive testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Archive and Delete System with Recently Deleted Section",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Implement archive buttons and UI, (2) Move archived items to hidden state in IndexedDB, (3) Build recently deleted section, (4) Implement 14-day purge logic, (5) Add restore functionality. For each, specify UI, data, and retention logic.",
			"reasoning": "Requires additional data states, retention logic, and UI for managing archived/deleted items. While not algorithmically complex, the need for reliable state transitions and retention adds moderate complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Tab Groups with Editable Headers and Context Menus",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Render tab group containers, (2) Implement inline editing of group names, (3) Integrate Lucide React icon picker, (4) Display tab count and open-all functionality, (5) Add context menu with actions (sort, duplicate, delete, archive), (6) Support group archiving and deletion. For each, specify UI and state logic.",
			"reasoning": "Combines interactive UI (editing, icon picking, context menus) with state management and group actions. Each feature is moderately complex and must work together seamlessly."
